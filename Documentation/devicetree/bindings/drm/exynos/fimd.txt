* Samsung Display Controller using DRM frame work

The display controller is used to transfer image data from memory to an
external LCD driver interface. It supports various color formats such as
rgb and yuv.

Required properties:
 - compatible: Should be "samsung,exynos5-fimd" or "samsung,exynos4-fimd" for
   fimd using DRM frame work.
 - reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory
   mapped region.
 - interrupts: Three interrupts should be specified. The interrupts should be
   specified in the following order.
   - VSYNC interrupt
   - FIFO level interrupt
   - FIMD System Interrupt
 - clocks: List of clock handles. The following must be specified:
   - fimd: Controls gating of aclk_200 to FIMD IP
   - sclk_fimd: Controls gating of FIMD pixel clock
   - mout_fimd: Mux to select parent of sclk_fimd
   - sclk_mout_fimd: Parent clock for mout_fimd
 - clock-names: Aliases for the above clocks. They should be "fimd",
   "sclk_fimd", "mout_fimd", and "sclk_mout_fimd", respectively.
 - samsung,fimd-display: This property should specify the phandle of the
   display device node which holds the video interface timing with the
   below mentioned properties.

 - samsung,default-window: Specifies the default window number of the fimd controller.

 - samsung,fimd-win-bpp: Specifies the bits per pixel.

 - samsung,fimd-src-clk-rate: Specifies the pixel clock rate.

Optional properties:
 - samsung,fimd-vidout-rgb: Video output format is RGB.
 - samsung,fimd-inv-vclk: invert video clock polarity.

Example:

	The following is an example for the fimd controller is split into
	two portions. The SoC specific portion can be specified in the SoC
	specific dts file. The board specific portion can be specified in the
	board specific dts file.

	- SoC Specific portion

	fimd {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos5-fimd";
		interrupt-parent = <&combiner>;
		reg = <0x14400000 0x40000>;
		interrupts = <18 5>, <18 4>, <18 6>;
	};

	- Board Specific portion

	fimd {
		samsung,fimd-vidout-rgb;
		samsung,fimd-inv-vclk;
		samsung,default-window = <0>;
		samsung,fimd-win-bpp = <32>;
	};
