* Exynos Thermal

Required properties:
- compatible: should be one of the following.
    * "samsung,exynos4210-tmu" - for controllers compatible with exynos4210 tmu.
    * "samsung,exynos5250-tmu" - for controllers compatible with exynos5250 tmu.
    * "samsung,exynos5420-tmu" - for controllers compatible with exynos5420 tmu.

- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of
  memory mapped region.

    ** NOTE FOR EXYNOS5420 **
    TRIMINFO register is being misplaced for TMU channels 2, 3 and 4

    TERMINFO for TMU channel 2 is present in address space of TMU channel 3
    TERMINFO for TMU channel 3 is present in address space of TMU channel 4
    TERMINFO for TMU channel 4 is present in address space of TMU channel 2

    * In such cases the reg property contains the misplaced register address and
      range as the second parameter.

- interrupts : interrupt number to the cpu.
- clocks : Clock number as per common clock framework for the cpu.  In the
  case of Exynos5420, a second clock may be specified if the TRIMINFO register
  is located on a separate TMU.
- clock-names : "tmu_apbif" for the TMU's gate clock and, if necessary,
  "tmu_apbif_triminfo" for the gate clock of the TMU which contains this TMU's
  TRIMINFO register.

Example:

	/* tmu for CPU0 */
	tmu@10060000 {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos5420-tmu";
		reg = <0x10060000 0x100>;
		interrupts = <0 65 0>;
		clocks = <&clock 318>;
		clock-names = "tmu_apbif";
	};

Example: In case of Exynos5420 TMU channel 3

	/* tmu for CPU3 */
	tmu@1006c000 {
		compatible = "samsung,exynos5420-tmu";
		/* 2nd reg is for the misplaced TRIMINFO register */
		reg = <0x1006c000 0x100>, <0x100a0000 0x4>;
		interrupts = <0 185 0>;
		clocks = <&clock 318>, <&clock 319>;
		clock-names = "tmu_apbif", "tmu_apbif_triminfo";
	};
